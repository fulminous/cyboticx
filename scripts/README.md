# Scripts
Setup scripts used in React and other applications

### Installation
```
yarn add -D @cyboticx/scripts

# or

npm install -D @cyboticx/scripts
```

### Usage
To run the image setup script, for instance, add `"make:images": "images"` to your package.json scripts and execute with `npm run make:images` or `yarn make:images`. You can do the same with the other scripts.

NB: Make sure your *images* directory follows the directory structure `src/res/images/` in the application. Same applies to *flags* and *fonts*.
